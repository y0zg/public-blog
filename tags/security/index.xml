      <description>AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) now supports automated certificate management for Kubernetes workloads through AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK).
Previously, using ACM certificates in Kubernetes required manual steps: exporting certificates via API, creating Kubernetes Secrets, and manually updating them at renewal. With ACK, you can define certificates as Kubernetes resources, and the controller automates the complete lifecycle - requesting, exporting, creating Secrets, and auto-updating at renewal.
This works for both public certificates (ACM exportable certificates) and private certificates (AWS Private CA), enabling automated certificate management for:</description>

The interesting part? They built a custom solution called tfstate-butler - a Go program that acts as an HTTP backend for Terraform state storage.
The Security Problem When you&amp;rsquo;re managing infrastructure at Cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s scale, a single compromised state file could be catastrophic.</description>
