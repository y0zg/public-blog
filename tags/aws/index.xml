      <description>AWS Billing Transfer is a new feature (GA since November 2025) that streamlines billing management across multiple AWS Organizations. It helps companies and channel partners who manage multiple Organizations by enabling centralized billing while keeping security and autonomy decentralized for business units or end customers.
Key Challenges Addressed  Multiple Organizations – Separate logins for billing and cost management across Organizations increase operational overhead No Central View – Hard to get a single, holistic view of spend across business units or customers Confidential Pricing – Protecting pricing data when billing and security roles are separated (e.</description>

      <title>ACM Finally Automates Certificate Management for Kubernetes</title>
      <link>https://okulbida.com/posts/acm-automated-certificate-management-kubernetes/</link>

      <description>AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) now supports automated certificate management for Kubernetes workloads through AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK).
Previously, using ACM certificates in Kubernetes required manual steps: exporting certificates via API, creating Kubernetes Secrets, and manually updating them at renewal. With ACK, you can define certificates as Kubernetes resources, and the controller automates the complete lifecycle - requesting, exporting, creating Secrets, and auto-updating at renewal.
This works for both public certificates (ACM exportable certificates) and private certificates (AWS Private CA), enabling automated certificate management for:</description>

      <title>AWS in 2025: Things You Think You Know That Are Actually Wrong</title>

      <description>You know what&amp;rsquo;s wild? AWS is almost twenty years old now. That&amp;rsquo;s both cool and kind of terrifying at the same time. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with AWS for a while, and honestly, I still catch myself thinking about things the way they used to be, not how they actually work today.
The problem is that AWS changes constantly, but a lot of the foundational stuff has evolved in ways that aren&amp;rsquo;t super obvious.</description>

      <title>AWS re:Invent 2025 Recap: Key Announcements for Cloud Practitioners</title>

      <description>Another year, another AWS re:Invent has come and gone. I&amp;rsquo;ve been following the announcements closely, and there are some genuinely interesting developments worth discussing.
The Big Picture This year&amp;rsquo;s re:Invent felt a bit different. The pre:Invent announcements started later than usual (mid-November instead of early October), and the keynote felt more focused on GenAI than infrastructure improvements. That said, there are still plenty of practical enhancements that can make our lives easier.</description>

      <title>AWS Finally Built a Browser for S3 (And Why It Took 20 Years)</title>
      <link>https://okulbida.com/posts/aws-s3-storage-browser-access-grants/</link>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s 2024, and AWS finally built a browser-based S3 viewer. Twenty years after S3 launched, you can now browse your buckets directly in the browser. It&amp;rsquo;s still in alpha, but hey, better late than never, right?
You might be thinking - wait, weren&amp;rsquo;t there options before? Like S3Fox? Yeah, there were some third-party tools, but AWS itself never had an official browser interface. So what took so long?
Real Problem: Access Control Turns out, building a simple file browser wasn&amp;rsquo;t the hard part.</description>

      <title>EKS with instance-store nitro-based node-group</title>

      <description>Userdata is compatible with the standard AWS EKS Terraform module, with the sole recommendation being the utilization of a custom AMI. In order to use instance-store you also need to install local-static-provisioner - https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/sig-storage-local-static-provisioner
Terraform example:
eks-dev-instance-store = { instance_types = [&amp;#34;r6id.large&amp;#34;] min_size = 1 max_size = 3 desired_size = 1 block_device_mappings = {# Root volume  xvda = { device_name = &amp;#34;/dev/xvda&amp;#34; ebs = { volume_size = 24 volume_type = &amp;#34;gp3&amp;#34; iops = 3000 encrypted = false delete_on_termination = true } } } ami_id = data.</description>

      <title>Simple rds access</title>
      <link>https://okulbida.com/posts/simple-rds-access/</link>

      <guid>https://okulbida.com/posts/simple-rds-access/</guid>
      <description>There are numerous solutions for accessing private RDS instances, many of which require thoughtful design. The solution I use sometimes is straightforward: I deploy it as a Helm chart within a k8s cluster. In this setup, access to the RDS is contingent on having access to the k8s cluster with the appropriate RBAC configurations. While it may not be perfect, it&amp;rsquo;s secure, quick to implement, and requires minimal maintenance. The following command demonstrates the basic principle:</description>

      <title>AWS removes NAT Gateway’s dependence on Internet Gateway for Private communications</title>
      <link>https://okulbida.com/posts/aws-nat-gateway-no-need-igw/</link>

      <guid>https://okulbida.com/posts/aws-nat-gateway-no-need-igw/</guid>
      <description>You can now launch NAT Gateways in your VPC without associating an internet gateway to your VPC. Internet Gateway is required to provide internet access to the NAT Gateway. However, some customers use their NAT Gateways with Transit Gateway or virtual private gateway to communicate privately with other VPCs or on-premises environments and thus, do not need an internet gateway attached to their VPCs.

      <title>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling Introduces Predictive Scaling as a Native Scaling Policy</title>
      <link>https://okulbida.com/posts/aws-ec2-predictive-autoscaling/</link>

      <guid>https://okulbida.com/posts/aws-ec2-predictive-autoscaling/</guid>
      <description>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling now natively supports Predictive Scaling so you can proactively scale out your Auto Scaling group to be ready for upcoming demand. Predictive Scaling can help you avoid the need to over-provision capacity, resulting in lower EC2 cost, while ensuring your application’s responsiveness. (Previously, Predictive Scaling was only available via AWS Auto Scaling Plans.)
