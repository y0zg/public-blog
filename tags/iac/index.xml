      <description>Essential Terraform best practices for organizing and structuring your infrastructure code:
1. Separate Configuration Files
Instead of putting all code in main.tf, distribute it across multiple files:
 main.tf: Calls modules, locals, and data sources to create all resources variables.tf: Contains variable declarations used in main.tf. Place required variables at the top and optional ones at the bottom, separated by a comment line for better readability outputs.tf: Contains outputs from resources created in main.</description>

      <description>Managing Terraform state securely is one of those things that seems simple until you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with hundreds of accounts and thousands of resources. Cloudflare, being their own Customer Zero, had to solve this problem at enterprise scale.
The interesting part? They built a custom solution called tfstate-butler - a Go program that acts as an HTTP backend for Terraform state storage.
The Security Problem When you&amp;rsquo;re managing infrastructure at Cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s scale, a single compromised state file could be catastrophic.</description>
