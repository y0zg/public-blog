      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s 2024, and AWS finally built a browser-based S3 viewer. Twenty years after S3 launched, you can now browse your buckets directly in the browser. It&amp;rsquo;s still in alpha, but hey, better late than never, right?
You might be thinking - wait, weren&amp;rsquo;t there options before? Like S3Fox? Yeah, there were some third-party tools, but AWS itself never had an official browser interface. So what took so long?
Real Problem: Access Control Turns out, building a simple file browser wasn&amp;rsquo;t the hard part.</description>
